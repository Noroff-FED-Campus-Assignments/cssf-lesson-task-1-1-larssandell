# Lesson Task CSS Frameworks 1.1

## Introduction to Bootstrap

### Brief

For this task, you will create a single page application that uses Bootstrap. You should not customise Bootstrap in any way or use custom CSS at all.

You can use an existing project, an upcoming or planned project, or a fictional project.

Design a landing page for your project that includes a header, navigation, and a footer. The navigation should scroll you to the correct location on the page. Include a form that allows the user to register their interest in your project.

3. Link the CDN Bootstrap CSS and JS files to your HTML
4. Use HTML + Bootstrap CDN to build the page
